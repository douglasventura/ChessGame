# ChessGame - Terminal Emulator Version

### How to run?
- You need: Java 17+ and a terminal emulator with color support
- Compile "App.java" using javac and execute .class file

### How it works?
When running the application, an 8 by 8 matrix is projected, where rows are represented in the range (1-8) and columns are represented in the range (a-h).
To start the game you must choose an origin piece using the "letter|number" coordinate, example: "b2", and then you must choose a destination position according to the possible moves.

- Note 1: Black pieces are painted yellow.
- Note 2: The piece represented by letter "N" is Knight.
